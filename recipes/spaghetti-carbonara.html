    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This spaghetti carbonara is a "bacon and egg" pasta dish. The dish uses olive oil, onion, garlic, white wine, pepper, Parmesan cheese, parsley and a pound of spaghetti.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.

        <li>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet. <p><img src="../img/spaghetti-carbonara-step-2.jpg" alt="An image of diced bacons cooked in oil in a large skillet." width="600"></p><br></li>

        <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more. <p><img src="../img/spaghetti-carbonara-step-3.jpg" alt="An image of a chopped onion cooked in olive oil in a large skillet." width="600"></p><br></li>
        
        <li>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty). <p><img src="../img/spaghetti-carbonara-step-4.jpg" alt="An image of spaghetti carbonara in a large skillet along with a tong." width="600"></p><br></li>

        <li>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table. <p><img src="../img/spaghetti-carbonara-step-5.jpg" alt="An image of spaghetti carbonara on a plate with Parmesan cheese and parslet sprinkled on top." width="600"></p><br></li>
